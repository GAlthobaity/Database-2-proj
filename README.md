# Database2 project
A database course's project using python and SQL

## Project implementation
The first phase of any project is planning. We set the goals and used
the Specialization technique, where each member was assigned to their
specialty.

We created a database, containing two tables, Login information, and
Employee information. Then we implemented the interface
design using the PYQT5 library and added functionality to it.
